I'm Jacob Pledger, a gamer, developer, and geek of many things. Welcome to my website.

I currently program cool things for a living at [Farmers Edge](https://www.farmersedge.ca). Perhaps you'd like to check out my [résumé](/resume.html).

Previously, I worked on the "data warehousing" side of things, creating and maintaining our big data systems for ingesting and handling collected farm device data.

Now, I'm on the Geospatial team working on ways to best leverage public cloud for our mapping systems.

In my off hours, I could be gaming, exercising, reading tech news, brushing up on infosec, or grasping at understanding the systems of the world.
