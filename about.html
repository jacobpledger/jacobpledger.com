I'm Jacob Pledger, a gamer, developer, and geek of many things.

I currently work on cool things in Python for a living at <a href="https://www.farmersedge.ca">Farmers Edge</a>. I work on our "data warehousing", components, but my main responsibility is to ingest, store, and make available data from various sources.
I am also the primary developer of our custom Alerts system backend, which we use to allow users to create rules with criteria to match against the data we are streaming in that they want to be notified about.

In my off hours, I could be gaming, exercising, reading tech news, brushing up on infosec, or grasping at understanding the systems of the world.
