# Asparagus Soup

### Ingredients:

#### Soup:
- [ ] 6 slices bacon, chopped, or 60 mL (1/4 cup) chopped pancetta
- [ ] 30 mL (2 tbsp) crème fraîche or plain Greek yogourt
- [ ] 5 mL (1tsp) butter
- [ ] 1 medium onion, chopped
- [ ] 1 kg (2lbs) asparagus, tough ends snapped off
- [ ] 1.4 L (6 cups) chicken stock
- [ ] salt and pepper to taste

#### Dill Croutons
- [ ] 60 mL (1/4 cup) butter
- [ ] 1/2 load of any style artisanal bread, cut into 2.5-cm (1 inch) cubes
- [ ] 10 mL (2 tsp) chopped fresh dill
- [ ] salt and pepper to taste

### Directions:

- [ ] Prepare the croutons: in a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the bread cubes and gently toss to coat in the butter.
- [ ] Cook, stirring often, until the bread is browned and crispy, 5 to 7 minutes.
- [ ] Remove from the heat, then sprinkle coutons with dill and salt and pepper.

#### Soup:
- [ ] In a large pot over medium-low heat, fry the bacon, stirring often, until crispy, about 5 minutes
- [ ] Use a slotted spoon to remove bacon from the pot but not the fat. Put the bacon in a bowl and set aside.
- [ ] Add the butter to the bacon fat and melt over low heat.
- [ ] Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened, about 8 minutes.
- [ ] Meanwhile, coarsely chop the asparagus.
- [ ] Add the asparagus to the pot, along with the chicken stock, salt, and pepper.
- [ ] Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
- [ ] Reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, until the asparagus is very tender, about 20 minutes.
- [ ] Remove the pot from the heat and add the crème fraîche.
- [ ] Using an immersion blender in the pot, blend the soup until smooth.
- [ ] Ladle the soup into warm bowls and sprinkle with the reserved bacon and dill croutons. Makes about 6 servings.
