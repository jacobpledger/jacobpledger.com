# Cookies & Creme Cookies

### Ingredients:

- [ ] 1 cup butter, softened
- [ ] 1/2 cup brown sugar
- [ ] 1/2 cup sugar
- [ ] 1 (4.2 oz) pkg Oreo Cookies & Cream pudding mix
- [ ] 2 eggs
- [ ] 1 tsp vanilla extract
- [ ] 2 1/4 cups flour
- [ ] 1 tsp baking soda
- [ ] 1 cup white chocolate chips
- [ ] 15 Oreo cookies, coarsely crushed (you want big chunks!)

### Directions:

- [ ] Using a hand mixer, cream the butter and sugars.  Add the pudding mix and mix until well blended.
- [ ] Add the eggs and vanilla and mix well.
- [ ] Add the flour and baking soda and continue mixing.
- [ ] Stir in the white chocolate chips and Oreo cookie chunks.
- [ ] Drop cookies by rounded teaspoonfuls (I use a cookie scoop) onto a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes at 350.  Enjoy!

### Notes:

* Instead of using 2 1/4 cups of flour, I just used 2 cups of flour.
Other than that I kept everything the same.

* Can substitute vanilla pudding mix instead of cookies and cream
pudding mix (might not have cookies and cream pudding mix in Canada)
