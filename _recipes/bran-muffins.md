# Bran Muffins

### Ingredients:

- [ ] 2 beaten eggs
- [ ] 1.75 Cups brown sugar
- [ ] 1 Cup oil
- [ ] 2 tsp vanilla
- [ ] 2 Cups sour cream
- [ ] 2 Cups flour
- [ ] 1.5 Cups bran or (1 Cup bran + 1/2 Cup rolled oats)
- [ ] 2 tsp baking soda
- [ ] 1 tsp salt

### Directions:

- [ ] In one bowl, mix together the eggs, oil, vanilla, and sour cream
- [ ] In another bowl, mix the sugar, flour, bran, baking soda and salt
- [ ] Combine and mix
- [ ] Grease muffin tins
- [ ] Fill muffin tins with the mixture
- [ ] Bake at 375℉ for about 20 minutes

### Notes:

* I have the big muffin tins, so I normally double everything.
* I don’t use that much sugar – usually ½ or less if I use juices.
* Only use sour cream if I have some left over, but I never buy any just special for this recipe.
* I don’t use that much oil – maybe half or less.
* Salt – 99% of the time I don’t add that either.

You can use shredded carrots, banana, zucchini (shredded), yogurt, granola  – pretty much anything.
The oranges – I wash them off, cut them in sections, putting one in at a time in the blender.  You will have to add  liquid (here’s where I like to use orange juice). Depending on your blender, you may have to empty it every so often in a separate bowl.  So, orange pieces (about 2 or 3 with a bit of liquid) blend, dump in bowl, and repeat this process until the orange is used up.  Too runny?  Add more bran/granola or flour.  Also if I have it I like to use orange flavouring.
