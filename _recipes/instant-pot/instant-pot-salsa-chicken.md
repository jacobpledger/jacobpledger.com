​# Instant Pot Southwestern Chicken and Rice

### Ingredients:

- [ ] 1.5 cups brown rice
- [ ] 3/4 cup salsa
- [ ] 1 15oz can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
- [ ] 1/2 cup frozen corn
- [ ] 1.5 cups chicken stock
- [ ] 1 teaspoon chili powder
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon cumin
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon salt
- [ ] 2 chicken breasts (about 1 pound)
- [ ] 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar chips
- [ ]hot sauce and more cheese for serving

### Directions:

1. Place the brown rice, salsa, kidney beans, corn and chicken stock in the instant pot. Stir to combine.
2. Nestle the chicken breasts (leave them whole so they won't get dry during cooking) down in the rice/liquid mixture. Sprinkle the chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin and salt partly over the chicken and partly over the liquid/rice mixture. Spread out the spices and mix some in with the liquid with spoon. (This doesn't have to be precise. Just get some in with the rice and some on the chicken.)
3. Secure the lid and cook on high pressure for 24 minutes (select Manual and then dial up or down to get to the correctly number of minutes; the IP will start on it’s own).
4. Let the pressure naturally release for 10 minutes and then quick release the rest of the pressure. Remove the chicken breasts and shred into bite-sized pieces. Fluff the rice with a fork and mix in the chicken and shredded cheese.
5. Serve topped with cheese, hot sauce and chips for dipping. Enjoy!

### Notes:

* You really just throw everything in the instant pot and let it cook.
* Good with tortilla chips

WITH FROZEN CHICKEN: Just keep the cook time the same. The long cook time is to ensure the rice cooks through so frozen or fresh chicken will work. It may take a few extra minutes for the pressure to come up, but the recipe will turn out great.
