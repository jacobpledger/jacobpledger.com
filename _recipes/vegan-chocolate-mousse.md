* makes: 4 portions (160 ml each)
* prep: 20 min
* cooking: 0 min

### Ingredients

<li><label><input type="checkbox">1 cup /240 ml aquafaba (from 400g / 14 oz can of low-sodium chickpeas OR home cooked chickpeas)</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox">140 g dark (70% cocoa) vegan chocolate</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox">20 g / 1 heaped tsbp white caster sugar (optional, SEE NOTES)*</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox">2 pinches of hot chilli powder (optional)</label></li>
GARNISH (optional)
<li><label><input type="checkbox">1 tbsp chocolate shavings</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox">a handful of pomegranate seeds</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox">a handful of chopped pistachios</label></li>

### Directions

<li><label><input type="checkbox">This recipe contains a step-by-step VIDEO (see above).</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox">Break the chocolate into smaller chunks and melt it very slowly over a water bath. My electric hob goes from 1-6, I used setting #2 to melt the chocolate – it’s important to do it slowly so that chocolate doesn’t overheat. Once the chocolate has melted, take the bowl off the water bath and place it on a kitchen towel to cool down a little.</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox">Open your tin of chickpeas and drain the chickpea water into large glass bowl. The bowl and the utensils you’ll use to whip aquafaba need to be completely grease-free as even the tiniest grease residue can prevent aquafaba from reaching stiff peaks. One 400 g tin should give you 240 ml / 1 cup of chickpea water. Reserve the chickpeas for another use, like a salad or burgers.</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox">Using an electric egg whisk, whip the chickpea water into stiff peaks – this is super important. The best way to check if you have achieved stiff peaks is to invert the bowl with whipped aquafaba. If aquafaba slides down even a tiny bit, you are not there yet – keep on whipping until it does not move at all. I used an old, hand-held whisk and it took me about 15 minutes to get stiff peaks. If you are a lucky owner of a stand mixer, it will happen quicker. The good news is that (as opposed to egg whites) aquafaba cannot be overwhipped.</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox">OPTIONAL STEP: Once you reach stiff peaks, start adding sugar, bit by bit, whipping the whole time. If sugar has caused the stiff peaks to perish, whip the mixture until you get stiff peaks again.</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox">Check that the chocolate has cooled down sufficiently – it should not be warm to the touch or else chocolate may seize and you will end up with grainy mousse.</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox">Gently fold melted chocolate into whipped aquafaba using a silicone spatula. Do not worry if your fluffy mixture deflates once the chocolate has been added – that’s perfectly normal. By the time you’ve added all of your melted chocolate, the mousse MAY have more of a pourable consistency.</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox">Add chilli powder if using and mix well. Divide the mixture between 4 glasses. Gently stir the mixture between putting it into individual glasses as a bit of melted chocolate tends to drop to the bottom sometimes.</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox">Put glasses into the fridge for minimum 3 hours for the mousse to set. I tend to chill mine overnight and it’s perfectly set and fluffy each time.</label></li>

### Notes

* The exact amount of sugar depends on your taste and how sweet your chocolate is. Sugar isn’t necessary though.
