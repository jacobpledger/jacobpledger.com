I'm Jacob Pledger, but I hope you knew that already.

I'm a gamer, programmer, internet citizen, cynical optimist, and aspiring human. Although sometimes I travel the web as a helpful doge.

Right now I program cool things for a living at [Farmers Edge](https://www.farmersedge.ca). Perhaps you'd like to check out my [résumé](/resume.html).

I'm currently on the Geospatial team working on ways to best leverage public cloud for our mapping systems.
Previously, I worked on the "data warehousing" side of things, creating and maintaining our big data systems for ingesting and handling collected farm device data.

In my off hours, I could be gaming, exercising, reading about tech and infosec, writing this blog, or grasping at understanding the systems of the world.
