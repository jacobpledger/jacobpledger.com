<section class="job-description">
This was my second co-op through the University of Lethbridge's co-operative education program.
The "Computers For Schools" program was a highlight.
There were a bunch of old computers and other equipment taking up space in the basement lockup, and we needed to do something with them.
I discovered the "Computers for Schools" program, and suggested that we donate them.
So the other co-op and I set up several of the machines in our office running DBAN to wipe the hard drives.
The wiped hard drives were shredded, but we palletized the computers they came out of and delivered them all to the University of Lethbridge near the end of the summer.
