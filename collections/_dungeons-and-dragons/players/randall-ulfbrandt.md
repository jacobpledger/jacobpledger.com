## Backstory:

My brother Eric and I grew up in Lake City, about 10 days ride from Helmcliff. We had an ordinary family, there's not much else to say there. My parents were merchant-class. Not poor, not rich. Craving excitement, I joined the Helmcliff city watch as soon as I could. Barely a man yet. I rose quickly and joined the Fangs of Fenrir, one of their specialst divisions. We were called in to clean up magical shit. Messes, accidents, the occasional dissenting wizard. Thirty years I served with my squad in the Fangs. We were as close as brothers, actually moreso than my actual brother, I miss them. 

Not that Eric and I were at odds, mind. He and I are just different people. He is more bookish than I ever was. My mother always said I had a wolf in my heart, a reference to our family name. I don't know where it came from. He followed my family's footsteps, opting for a more desk-bound job. All the better for him. He made himself a family and settled down in our home town. I never found a family. Married to the watch I suppose. I had my brothers.

But Sibyl...

I was younger then. A damn fool. But then she went along with it. Sometimes I wonder if she regrets it. Sometimes I wonder if I do.

Sibyl met my brother by chance in the market. Love at first sight sort of thing. At least it was for him. They were happy togther, and still are I think. But whenever I visited, she was always *attentive*. I think I was exciting to her. Maybe I still am, but as I said we were younger then - not that that means as much to an Elf. Maybe she loves us both. I think that's true. But she chose him. And of course she did, that was the life she wanted. 

They had been trying for kids but hadn't succeeded. I don't remember how it happened, she was frustrated, and I was on a high after five years in the Fangs, fresh off a big takedown. Things escalated.
From me Sibyl had a daughter, Eri. I just... didn't say anything. And as far as I know neither did she. I couldn't tell my brother.

Eri - Erilaz, turned out to be like me - *adventurous*. She left and set out on her own when she was twenty. Shortly before this whole mess. I don't know where she is now.

It was a job we had done many times before. Simple infiltration and neutralization of a wizard gone barmy. They didn’t tell us much and they didn’t have to, we just had to clean up the mess. My squad died to a man.

I made a mistake and it cost us everything. I split from the group - broke off to hunt the bastard down when he ran. He caught me with some sort of enchantment. I slew my own brothers myself. They didn't expect a knife in their backs. Afterwords the wizard gave me what I deserved. Mostly. He must have left some ash. I often wish he hadn't.

6 months ago I woke up at my brother’s house in Lake City, my brother and his wife standing over me. How they resurrected me she wouldn’t say, but I know it was her who did it.

Since I had died, I had been discharged, and with my unit dead I had no real reason to return. I am now over 50, so I doubt they would even take me back, except as an instructor, which I am not. But I know she paid a price to bring me back, and a steep one. She should have left me dead. But since I’m alive, I need to try and fix this. Luckily, Grand Wizard Melkond has put out a request for people of my skillset and is offering “great rewards”.
So now I’m on my way back to Helmcliff. We meet up in Dockside, Port 12b, at sunrise.
